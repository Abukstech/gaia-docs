# System requirements

You can install the GaiaNet on a wide variety of devices and operating systems with or without GPUs. The node installing and operating instructions work on devices ranging from Raspberry Pi, MacBooks, Linux servers, Windows Desktop, to cloud-based Nvidia H100 clusters. For institutional operators, we recommend EITHER of the following for a GaiaNet node. 


* Mac desktop or server computers (i.e., iMac, Mini, Studio or Pro) with Apple Silicon (M1 to M4), and at least 16GB of RAM (32GB or more recommended).
* Ubuntu Linux 22.04 server with Nvidia CUDA 12 SDK installed. At least 8GB of VRAM on the GPU is required (24GB or more recommended). On AWS and Azure, that means GPU instances with at least the Nvidia T4 GPU installed.

> Check out our [tutorial](tasks/cuda) on how to install the Nvidia driver and the CUDA toolkit on a Ubuntu 22.04 machine.

If you are hosting the node in your home or office, it needs access to the public Internet to join the GaiaNet network.
