### Supervise

If you're a frequent Gaianet node runner, we recommend using the supervise tool to manage nodes effectively.

For macOS users, you can install the daemontools tool by running the following command:

```
brew install daemontools
```

For Linux users, please refer to [the installation guide](https://cr.yp.to/daemontools/install.html) to install the `daemontools` tool.
